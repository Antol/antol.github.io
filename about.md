I am a problem solver. Usually, I make it trough writing code, but not always.

For me, the best Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything is 42. But besides that, I think that everyone should bring something good to that life. It can be a new theorem, sculpture, vaccine or even wooden chair. It doesn’t actually matter you just need to make someone happier. Solving someone’s problem is a good way to make someone happier whether it is a client, user or yourself.

At this moment I have 5+ years of coding experience and I think I am good at that. But of course, there is a lot of things to learn to be better. I have read a bunch of books about how to write clean, robust code (SOLID, TDD, and stuff), I have tried few paradigms (Procedural, Object-oriented, Functional, Reactive), I have used some architectures (MVP, MVVM, VIPER, etc.) and I still not 100% sure on every written line of code. But I believe in “good enough” solution which keeps my perfectionism beast in a cage.

Why I love this work? Because it is very interesting and sometimes even fun! You write some magic words and symbols, tap run button and the new world never existed before becoming alive. You can create everything (if you have enough time, of course). Isn’t that amazing?

I worked on such apps like easyJet, Buy Me a Pie, Drum Pads 24, Lifehacker. I with my friends founded a small company named Perpetuum Mobile lab. Helped my wife with development of jewelry brand Wild Wild Heart

That’s enough serious talks about work. I’m just a guy who loves video games and dreamed in childhood to be a game developer (Actually, I made 2 but you barely heard about them). I am trying to lead a healthy lifestyle but still love beer and unhealthy food. I love snowboarding and American football (Not just watching, but also playing). And of course, I love my family and friends, who am I without them.

The main reason for that blog is sharing some useful findings to the community. Also, it is the place for me to train my writing English, so don’t laugh too much at my stupid mistakes (If you will find some - let me know, please)
